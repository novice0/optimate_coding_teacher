Explain stars in simple terms. A star is a massive, luminous ball of gas that is held together by its own gravity. Stars are formed when a giant cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity, and they can be found in our galaxy, the Milky Way. Stars come in different sizes and colors, and they can be classified into different types based on their characteristics. The Sun, which is the star at the center of our solar system, is a G-type main-sequence star. This means that it is a medium-sized star that is fusing hydrogen into helium in its core. The Sun is also a yellow dwarf star, which is a type of star that is small and cool.

## Step 1: Define what a star is
A star is a massive, luminous ball of gas that is held together by its own gravity.

## Step 2: Explain how stars are formed
Stars are formed when a giant cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity.

## Step 3: Describe the characteristics of stars
Stars come in different sizes and colors, and they can be classified into different types based on their characteristics.

## Step 4: Explain the Sun's classification
The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, meaning it is a medium-sized star that is fusing hydrogen into helium in its core.

## Step 5: Describe the Sun's color
The Sun is also a yellow dwarf star, which is a type of star that is small and cool.

The final answer is: There is no numerical answer for this problem, as it is an explanatory text.
